# PHYSIS – Recursive Reflective Language (v1.0 → v2.0)

**Physis** is a recursive, reflective, and emotionally modulated symbolic language designed to mirror the structure of natural thought, emotion, and causality.

---

## 🌱 0. Origins: Physis v1.0

Physis v1.0 was born as an experiment in non-linear thought representation. It offered:

- Recursive symbolic rules: `@X := [A, B, X]`
- Emotional modulation using `%`: `Joy %0.9`
- Conceptual loops, ψ-state exploration, and ΔA (adequacy) growth
- First visualization of semantic trees

It laid the philosophical and structural foundation for version 2.

---

## 🌿 1. Introduction (v2.0)

Physis v2.0 introduces a robust semantic grammar, a dynamic interpreter, and the first steps toward training AI with reflection trees instead of flat tokens.

---

## 🔣 2. Language Features

- `<>` → Reflective node marker
- `->` → Causal linkage (Cause → Effect)
- `%` → Emotional modulation (ΔP)
- `#` → Semantic labels
- `...` → Recursive unfolding
- `@Name := [Rule]` → Named grammar constructs

---

## 🧠 3. Physis Engine

The Physis engine parses and evaluates meaning trees. Nodes carry:
- modulation `%`
- reflectivity `<>`
- causal linkage `->`
- semantic tagging `#`

A demo interpreter and parser are implemented in Python.

## 🧪 4. Demo Grammar

```physis
@Emotion := [Joy %1.0 | Sadness %0.3]
@Loop := [Emotion::Joy -> Thought]...
@Thought := [#Idea %0.9, Reflection | Ψloop]
@Reflection := [Cause -> Effect] <> 
@Ψloop := [Idea, Ψloop]...
```

## ✒️ 5. Visual Identity

The PHYSIS logo and visual design incorporate a calligraphic font and fractal emblem to symbolize clarity, recursion, and emergence.

---

## 🤖 6. Training AI with Physis

Physis enables a new kind of AI:
- Input: semantic trees
- Output: symbolic reflections
- Learning signal: ψ, ΔP, A (adequacy growth)

We propose:
- Fine-tuning LLMs with tree-based symbolic datasets
- Using graph neural networks or TreeLSTM models
- Reinforcement learning with ΔA objectives

- `physis_engine_v2.py` – Interpreter
- `physis_parser_v2_full.py` – Grammar Parser
- `examples/` – Reflection demos
